Let's begin with the first lesson:

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Java

#### What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It was released in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Java is known for its platform independence, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

#### Why Learn Java?
Java is widely used in various domains, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise applications, scientific computing, and more. Learning Java opens up opportunities in these fields and provides a solid foundation for further learning in the cybersecurity domain, as many security tools and frameworks are written in Java.

#### Getting Started
To write and run Java programs, you need to set up a development environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Visit the official Oracle website and download the latest version of the JDK for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: After installing the JDK, you need to set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory. Additionally, add the JDK's `bin` directory to the `PATH` variable.

3. **Choose a Text Editor or IDE**: You can write Java code in any text editor, but using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools, which can greatly improve your productivity.

4. **Write Your First Java Program**: Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started.

Here's the code:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
Explanation:
- `public class HelloWorld`: This line declares a class named `HelloWorld`. In Java, every program must have at least one class, and the filename must match the class name.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of the Java program. It takes an array of strings as input arguments.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: This line prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

#### Running Your Program
After saving the above code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`, follow these steps to compile and run the program:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where `HelloWorld.java` is saved.
3. Compile the program by typing: `javac HelloWorld.java`
4. Run the program by typing: `java HelloWorld`

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed to the console.

Congratulations! You've written and executed your first Java program. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into Java syntax and explore variables and data types.
