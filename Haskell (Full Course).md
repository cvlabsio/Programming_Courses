# Lesson 1: Introduction to Haskell
Haskell is a statically typed language, meaning that types are checked at compile time. This ensures robustness and helps catch errors early in the development process. Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program.

```haskell
-- Lesson1.hs
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

Explanation:
- In Haskell, `main` is a special function that serves as the entry point for the program.
- `::` is a type annotation, indicating that `main` has a type of `IO ()`, which means it performs I/O (input/output) operations and returns no meaningful value.
- `putStrLn` is a function that takes a `String` (text) as input and prints it to the console.
- `"Hello, World!"` is a `String` literal.

Compile and run the program:
1. Save the code in a file named `Lesson1.hs`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `Lesson1.hs`.
4. Compile the program using GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) with the command: `ghc Lesson1.hs`
5. Run the executable produced by GHC: `./Lesson1`

You should see "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

Lesson 2: Basic Syntax and Functions
Let's explore basic syntax and define functions in Haskell.

```haskell
-- Lesson2.hs
-- Define a function to calculate the square of a number
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

-- Define a function to check if a number is even
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven n = n `mod` 2 == 0

-- Define a function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

Explanation:
- `square` takes an `Int` as input and returns an `Int`.
- `isEven` checks if an `Int` is even and returns a `Bool`.
- `factorial` calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer recursively.

Compile and run the program following the same steps as before.

Lesson 3: Pattern Matching and Lists
Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Haskell. Let's explore it along with lists.

```haskell
-- Lesson3.hs
-- Define a function to get the head of a list
getHead :: [a] -> a
getHead (x:_) = x

-- Define a function to get the tail of a list
getTail :: [a] -> [a]
getTail (_:xs) = xs

-- Define a function to sum all elements in a list recursively
sumList :: Num a => [a] -> a
sumList [] = 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs
```

Explanation:
- `getHead` extracts the first element of a list.
- `getTail` returns the remaining elements of a list after removing the head.
- `sumList` calculates the sum of all elements in a list recursively.

Compile and run the program.

These are the foundational concepts of Haskell. In the next lessons, we'll delve deeper into advanced topics such as higher-order functions, type classes, monads, and more, all of which are crucial for understanding Haskell thoroughly and applying it effectively in the field of cybersecurity.

Lesson 4: Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They are a fundamental aspect of functional programming.

```haskell
-- Lesson4.hs
-- Define a function to apply a function to each element of a list
mapList :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
mapList _ [] = []
mapList f (x:xs) = f x : mapList f xs

-- Define a function to filter elements of a list based on a predicate
filterList :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filterList _ [] = []
filterList p (x:xs)
  | p x       = x : filterList p xs
  | otherwise = filterList p xs

-- Define a function to fold (reduce) a list from the left
foldlList :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldlList _ acc [] = acc
foldlList f acc (x:xs) = foldlList f (f acc x) xs
```

Explanation:
- `mapList` applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list.
- `filterList` retains only those elements of a list that satisfy a predicate.
- `foldlList` folds (reduces) a list from the left using a binary function and an initial accumulator value.

Compile and run the program.

Lesson 5: Type Classes
Type classes define a set of functions that can be implemented by types. They enable ad-hoc polymorphism, allowing different types to behave differently with the same function name.

```haskell
-- Lesson5.hs
-- Define a type class for equality comparison
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  x == y = not (x /= y)
  x /= y = not (x == y)

-- Define an instance of Eq for the Integer type
instance Eq Integer where
  x == y = x `mod` 10 == y `mod` 10
```

Explanation:
- We define a type class `Eq` with two functions, `(==)` and `(/=)`, representing equality and inequality comparison, respectively.
- We provide default implementations for `(==)` and `(/=)` in terms of each other.
- We create an instance of `Eq` for the `Integer` type, overriding the default implementation for `(==)`.

Compile and run the program.

These concepts form the backbone of Haskell programming. In the next lessons, we'll explore more advanced topics such as monads, functors, and type-level programming, which will further enhance your understanding and enable you to leverage Haskell effectively in the cybersecurity domain.


Lesson 6: Monads
Monads are a central concept in Haskell, providing a way to sequence computations with side effects while maintaining purity. They are crucial for handling I/O, state, and other impure operations in a functional programming context.

```haskell
-- Lesson6.hs
-- Define a simple Maybe monad example
safeDivide :: Double -> Double -> Maybe Double
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing
safeDivide x y = Just (x / y)

-- Define a function to chain computations using the Maybe monad
exampleMaybe :: Maybe Double
exampleMaybe = do
  x <- safeDivide 10 2
  y <- safeDivide 20 x
  safeDivide 30 y
```

Explanation:
- `safeDivide` is a function that divides two `Double` numbers safely, returning `Just result` or `Nothing` if the divisor is zero.
- `exampleMaybe` demonstrates monadic sequencing using the `Maybe` monad. It chains computations that may fail, short-circuiting if any step returns `Nothing`.

Compile and run the program.

Lesson 7: Functors and Applicatives
Functors and applicatives are abstractions for applying functions within a context. They provide powerful tools for composing computations in a functional style.

```haskell
-- Lesson7.hs
-- Define a Functor instance for Maybe
instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap _ Nothing  = Nothing
  fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)

-- Define an Applicative instance for Maybe
instance Applicative Maybe where
  pure = Just
  Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
  (Just f) <*> something = fmap f something

-- Define a function to combine two Maybe values
combineMaybe :: Maybe (Int -> Int -> Int)
combineMaybe = Just (+)

-- Apply the combined function to two Maybe values
resultMaybe :: Maybe Int
resultMaybe = combineMaybe <*> Just 5 <*> Just 3
```

Explanation:
- We define instances of the `Functor` and `Applicative` type classes for the `Maybe` type, allowing us to map functions over `Just` values and apply functions within the `Maybe` context.
- `combineMaybe` combines two `Maybe` values containing functions.
- `resultMaybe` applies the combined function to two `Just` values, yielding a result within the `Maybe` context.

Compile and run the program.

These concepts are essential for understanding how to work with computational contexts in Haskell. In the next lessons, we'll explore more advanced topics such as type-level programming, concurrency, and advanced data structures, which will further deepen your understanding and proficiency in Haskell, making it a valuable tool in your cybersecurity endeavors.


Lesson 8: Type-Level Programming
Haskell's type system is incredibly expressive and allows for powerful type-level programming. This enables us to encode complex constraints and ensure correctness at compile time.

```haskell
-- Lesson8.hs
-- Define a type-level natural number representation
data Nat = Z | S Nat

-- Define type-level addition of natural numbers
type family Add (m :: Nat) (n :: Nat) :: Nat where
  Add Z n = n
  Add (S m) n = S (Add m n)

-- Define a type-level list
data HList (ts :: [Type]) where
  HNil :: HList '[]
  (:>) :: t -> HList ts -> HList (t ': ts)
infixr 5 :>
```

Explanation:
- We define a type-level representation of natural numbers (`Nat`) using the Peano axioms, where `Z` represents zero and `S` represents the successor.
- We use type families (`Add`) to perform type-level addition of natural numbers.
- We define a type-level heterogeneous list (`HList`) parameterized by a type-level list (`[Type]`). It can hold elements of different types.

Compile and run the program.

Lesson 9: Concurrency and Parallelism
Haskell provides powerful abstractions for concurrent and parallel programming, enabling efficient and scalable solutions.

```haskell
-- Lesson9.hs
import Control.Concurrent.Async (async, wait)

-- Define a function to compute Fibonacci numbers asynchronously
fibAsync :: Int -> IO Integer
fibAsync n = do
  asyncResult <- async (return $ fib n)
  wait asyncResult

-- Define the Fibonacci function
fib :: Int -> Integer
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

Explanation:
- We use `Control.Concurrent.Async` module to asynchronously compute Fibonacci numbers.
- `fibAsync` spawns a new asynchronous computation for calculating the Fibonacci number of `n`.
- `fib` calculates Fibonacci numbers recursively.

Compile and run the program.

Lesson 10: Advanced Data Structures
Haskell allows for the creation of advanced data structures using algebraic data types and type-level programming.

```haskell
-- Lesson10.hs
-- Define a binary search tree
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)

-- Define insertion into a binary search tree
insert :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert x Empty = Node x Empty Empty
insert x (Node val left right)
  | x < val   = Node val (insert x left) right
  | otherwise = Node val left (insert x right)
```

Explanation:
- We define a binary search tree (`Tree`) using an algebraic data type.
- `insert` inserts a value into the binary search tree while maintaining the ordering property.

Compile and run the program.

These advanced topics in Haskell further enhance your understanding and proficiency in the language, making it a powerful tool in your cybersecurity toolkit. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex problems and develop robust and efficient solutions in your cybersecurity endeavors. If you have any specific areas you'd like to delve deeper into or any questions, feel free to ask!


Lesson 11: Error Handling and Monadic Effects
Handling errors effectively is crucial in any programming language. Haskell provides powerful mechanisms for managing errors using monads and monad transformers.

```haskell
-- Lesson11.hs
import Control.Monad.Except

-- Define a custom error type
data MyError = DivByZero | NegativeInput deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Define a function to perform division with error handling
safeDivide' :: Double -> Double -> Except MyError Double
safeDivide' _ 0 = throwError DivByZero
safeDivide' x y
  | y < 0     = throwError NegativeInput
  | otherwise = return (x / y)

-- Use safeDivide' in a monadic context
exampleMonad :: Except MyError Double
exampleMonad = do
  result <- safeDivide' 10 2
  result' <- safeDivide' 20 result
  safeDivide' 30 result'
```

Explanation:
- We import `Control.Monad.Except` module to work with the `Except` monad transformer.
- We define a custom error type `MyError` to represent possible errors.
- `safeDivide'` is similar to `safeDivide` from Lesson 6 but uses `Except` monad for error handling.
- `exampleMonad` demonstrates error handling using the `Except` monad.

Compile and run the program.

Lesson 12: Interfacing with External Libraries
Haskell provides seamless interoperability with external libraries written in other languages like C. This allows leveraging existing libraries and integrating Haskell into larger projects.

```haskell
-- Lesson12.hs
{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-}

import Foreign.C.Types

-- Declare an external C function for calculating the square root
foreign import ccall "math.h sqrt"
  c_sqrt :: CDouble -> CDouble

-- Define a Haskell wrapper for the square root function
sqrt' :: Double -> Double
sqrt' = realToFrac . c_sqrt . realToFrac
```

Explanation:
- We use `ForeignFunctionInterface` language extension to declare an external C function `sqrt`.
- `foreign import ccall` directive specifies the calling convention and name of the C function.
- We define a Haskell wrapper function `sqrt'` that converts between Haskell and C types and calls the C function.

Compile and run the program. Note: You may need to link against the math library when compiling.

These advanced topics in Haskell further expand your toolkit and empower you to solve a wide range of problems efficiently and elegantly. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-prepared to tackle advanced challenges in cybersecurity and develop innovative solutions. If you have any specific areas you'd like to delve deeper into or any questions, feel free to ask!


Lesson 13: Lazy Evaluation and Infinite Data Structures
Haskell's lazy evaluation allows for the creation of infinite data structures and efficient computation on them. This feature is particularly useful for handling streams and generating sequences.

```haskell
-- Lesson13.hs
-- Define an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers
fibonacci :: [Integer]
fibonacci = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibonacci (tail fibonacci)

-- Take the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
firstTenFib :: [Integer]
firstTenFib = take 10 fibonacci
```

Explanation:
- We define an infinite list `fibonacci` using recursion and lazy evaluation. It starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous two.
- `zipWith` combines two lists using a binary function. In this case, it adds corresponding elements from `fibonacci` and its tail.
- We use `take` to extract the first 10 elements from the infinite list, creating a finite list.

Compile and run the program. Note: You can work with infinite lists because Haskell evaluates expressions lazily, only computing values as needed.

Lesson 14: Advanced Type System Features
Haskell's rich type system allows for expressing complex relationships between types and enforcing powerful constraints at compile time. We'll explore GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types) as an example.

```haskell
-- Lesson14.hs
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}

-- Define a GADT for expressions
data Expr a where
  IVal :: Int -> Expr Int
  BVal :: Bool -> Expr Bool
  Add :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
  Mul :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
  Not :: Expr Bool -> Expr Bool

-- Evaluate an expression
eval :: Expr a -> a
eval (IVal n) = n
eval (BVal b) = b
eval (Add e1 e2) = eval e1 + eval e2
eval (Mul e1 e2) = eval e1 * eval e2
eval (Not e) = not (eval e)
```

Explanation:
- We define a GADT `Expr` to represent expressions with integer and boolean values, addition, multiplication, and negation.
- Each constructor in the GADT has a specific type associated with it, enforcing type safety.
- The `eval` function evaluates an expression and returns its value.

Compile and run the program. Note: GADTs enable more precise type representations and facilitate type-safe programming.

These advanced topics in Haskell further deepen your understanding and proficiency in the language, making it a powerful tool in your cybersecurity toolkit.

-- Define a function to compute Fibonacci numbers concurrently
fibConcurrent :: Int -> IO Integer
fibConcurrent n = do
  result <- newEmptyMVar
  _ <- async $ putMVar result (fib n)
  takeMVar result
```

Explanation:
- We import modules `Control.Concurrent` and `Control.Concurrent.Async` for working with concurrency in Haskell.
- `newEmptyMVar` creates a new empty `MVar`, a mutable variable that can be shared between threads.
- We use `async` to asynchronously compute the Fibonacci number of `n` and put the result into the `MVar`.
- `takeMVar` blocks until the result is available, then retrieves and returns it.

Compile and run the program. Note: You can observe the performance improvement of concurrent computation, especially for computationally intensive tasks.

Lesson 16: Metaprogramming with Template Haskell
Template Haskell is an advanced feature of Haskell that allows for metaprogramming, enabling the generation and manipulation of Haskell code at compile time.

genIntList n = do
  let xs = map (\i -> clause [litP (IntegerL i)] (normalB (litE (IntegerL i))) []) [1..n]
  return [FunD (mkName "intList") xs]

-- Generate a list of integers at compile time
$(genIntList 10)
```

Explanation:
- We use the `TemplateHaskell` language extension to enable Template Haskell features.
- `genIntList` is a Template Haskell function that generates a list of integers from 1 to `n` at compile time.
- We use `mkName`, `litP`, `normalB`, and `litE` functions to construct patterns and expressions in the generated code.

-- Lesson17.hs
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

import Control.Lens

-- Define a data type with nested fields
data Person = Person
  { _name :: String
  , _age :: Int
  , _address :: Address
  } deriving (Show)

data Address = Address
  { _city :: String
  , _country :: String
  } deriving (Show)

-- Generate lenses for accessing fields
makeLenses ''Person
makeLenses ''Address

-- Update nested fields using lenses
updatePerson :: Person -> Person
updatePerson = set (address . city) "New York" . over age (* 2)
```

Explanation:
- We define a data type `Person` with nested fields `_name`, `_age`, and `_address`, and another data type `Address` with `_city` and `_country`.
- We use `makeLenses` template Haskell function to generate lenses for accessing and modifying fields.
- The `set` and `over` functions from the lens library allow us to update nested fields in a functional and composable manner.

Compile and run the program. Note: Lenses provide a powerful and concise way to work with complex data structures, improving code readability and maintainability.

Lesson 18: Parsing and Pretty-Printing with Megaparsec

```haskell
-- Lesson18.hs
import Text.Megaparsec
import Text.Megaparsec.Char
import Data.Void

-- Define a parser for simple arithmetic expressions
type Parser = Parsec Void String

expr :: Parser Int
expr = makeExprParser term operators

term :: Parser Int
term = try (parens expr) <|> integer

operators :: [[Operator Parser Int]]
operators =
  [ [ InfixL (reservedOp "*" >> return (*))
    , InfixL (reservedOp "/" >> return div) ]
  , [ InfixL (reservedOp "+" >> return (+))
    , InfixL (reservedOp "-" >> return (-)) ]
  ]

reservedOp :: String -> Parser ()
reservedOp s = spaceConsumer *> string s *> spaceConsumer

spaceConsumer :: Parser ()
spaceConsumer = hidden $ space <|> newline

integer :: Parser Int
integer = spaceConsumer *> lexeme (read <$> some digitChar)

parens :: Parser a -> Parser a
parens = between (char '(' *> spaceConsumer) (char ')' *> spaceConsumer)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  input <- getLine
  case parse expr "" input of
    Left err -> putStrLn $ errorBundlePretty err
    Right result -> print result
```

Explanation:
- We define a parser `expr` for simple arithmetic expressions using `makeExprParser` combinator, which handles operator precedence and associativity.
- The `operators` list defines operator precedence and associativity.
- We use Megaparsec's combinators like `try`, `makeExprParser`, `lexeme`, `between`, etc., to build the parser for arithmetic expressions.
- The `main` function reads an arithmetic expression from the user, parses it, and prints the result or error message.

Compile and run the program. Note: Megaparsec provides a flexible and efficient way to parse complex grammars, making it suitable for various parsing tasks in cybersecurity applications.

incrementCounter counter = modifyTVar' counter (+1)

-- Function to read the counter value atomically
readCounter :: Counter -> STM Int
readCounter counter = readTVar counter

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  counter <- atomically newCounter
  atomically $ do
    incrementCounter counter

Lesson 23: Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) with Reflex
Reflex is a Haskell library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), which allows you to build interactive and responsive user interfaces in a declarative and composable way.

```haskell
-- Lesson23.hs
{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}
import Reflex
import Reflex.Dom

-- Define a simple counter widget using Reflex
counterWidget :: (DomBuilder t m, PostBuild t m) => m ()
counterWidget = mdo
  -- Event that fires whenever the increment button is clicked
  incrementClick <- button "Increment"
  
  -- Dynamic value representing the current count
  count <- foldDyn (+) 0 (1 <$ incrementClick)

  -- Display the count
  display count

-- Main function to run the counter widget
main :: IO ()
main = mainWidget counterWidget
```

Explanation:
- We import modules from Reflex and Reflex.Dom libraries for building FRP-based web applications.
- `counterWidget` is a simple widget that consists of an increment button and a display of the current count.
- `foldDyn` accumulates the number of times the increment button is clicked and updates the count accordingly.
- `main` function runs the counter widget in a web browser using the `mainWidget` function provided by Reflex.Dom.

To run this program, you'll need to set up a Reflex development environment and compile it with GHCJS. You can find more information about setting up Reflex and building FRP-based web applications in the Reflex documentation.

Lesson 24: Property-Based Testing with QuickCheck
QuickCheck is a Haskell library for property-based testing, which allows you to specify properties that your code should satisfy and automatically generate test cases to verify them.

```haskell
-- Lesson24.hs
import Test.QuickCheck

-- Property: Doubling a number and then halving it should yield the original number
prop_DoubleHalve :: Double -> Property
prop_DoubleHalve x = x >= 0 ==> (x == ((x * 2) / 2))

-- Property: Reversing a list twice should yield the original list
prop_ReverseReverse :: [Int] -> Bool

main = do
    -- Serialize the person to a ByteString
    let serialized = toStrict . toLazyByteString $ encodeMessage person
    -- Print the serialized data
    T.putStrLn $ "Serialized Person: " <> show serialized
    -- Deserialize the serialized data back to a Person
    case decodeMessage (fromLazyByteString serialized) of
        Left err -> putStrLn $ "Error decoding message: " ++ err
        Right decoded -> do
            -- Print the decoded Person
            T.putStrLn "Decoded Person:"

  request <- parseRequest url
  response <- httpLbs request manager
  return $ responseBody response

-- Function to extract links from HTML content
extractLinks :: String -> [String]
extractLinks html = map (fromAttrib "href") $ filter isTagOpenName $ parseTags html

-- Main function
main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Fetch HTML content from a URL
  html <- fetchHTML "https://example.com"
  -- Extract links from the HTML content
  let links = extractLinks html
  -- Print the extracted links
  mapM_ putStrLn links
```

Explanation:
- We import modules from `Network.HTTP.Client` and `Text.HTML.TagSoup` for making HTTP requests and parsing HTML, respectively.
- The `fetchHTML` function makes an HTTP request to a URL and retrieves the HTML content.
- The `extractLinks` function parses the HTML content and extracts links from it.
- In the `main` function, we fetch HTML content from a URL and extract links from it, then print the extracted links.

To run this program, you'll need to install the `http-client`, `http-client-tls`, and `tagsoup` libraries and compile it with GHC. Then you can execute the program to fetch HTML content from a URL and extract links from it.

-- Lesson44.hs
{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}

import Reflex
import Reflex.Dom

-- Main function
main :: IO ()
main = mainWidget bodyElement

-- Define the body of the HTML page
bodyElement :: MonadWidget t m => m ()
bodyElement = el "div" $ do
  el "h1" $ text "Counter Example"
  rec
    -- Create a button to increment the counter

Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a concurrency control mechanism in Haskell that allows safe and composable coordination of concurrent operations. The `Control.Concurrent.STM` module provides abstractions for working with STM in Haskell.

```haskell
-- Lesson47.hs
import Control.Concurrent
import Control.Concurrent.STM

-- Function to transfer money between accounts using STM
transfer :: TVar Int -> TVar Int -> Int -> IO ()
transfer fromTVar toTVar amount = atomically $ do
  fromBalance <- readTVar fromTVar
  when (fromBalance >= amount) $ do
    modifyTVar' fromTVar (subtract amount)
    modifyTVar' toTVar (+ amount)

-- Main function
main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Create two accounts with initial balances
  fromTVar <- newTVarIO 100
  toTVar <- newTVarIO 0
  -- Transfer money from one account to another concurrently
  forkIO $ transfer fromTVar toTVar 50
  forkIO $ transfer fromTVar toTVar 75
  -- Print the final balances
  threadDelay 1000000
  fromBalance <- readTVarIO fromTVar
  toBalance <- readTVarIO toTVar
  putStrLn $ "From Balance: " ++ show fromBalance
  putStrLn $ "To Balance: " ++ show toBalance
```

Explanation:
- We import modules from `Control.Concurrent.STM` for working with STM in Haskell.
- The `transfer` function transfers money between accounts using STM. It reads the balances atomically, checks if there's enough balance in the source account, and updates the balances atomically.
- In the `main` function, we create two accounts with initial balances and transfer money between them concurrently using `forkIO`.
- We use `readTVarIO` to read the balances outside the STM monad for printing the final balances.

To run this program, you'll need to compile it with GHC. Then you can execute the program to see concurrency with STM in action, transferring money between accounts safely and concurrently.

Lesson 48: Interfacing with C Libraries using FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) in Haskell allows you to call C functions and work with C data structures from Haskell code. This enables interoperability with existing C libraries and systems.

```haskell
-- Lesson48.hs
{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-}

module Main where

import Foreign.C.Types

-- Define a foreign import declaration for the C function
foreign import ccall "math.h sin" c_sin :: CDouble -> CDouble

-- Main function
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = 3.14 :: Double
      result = realToFrac (c_sin (realToFrac x)) :: Double
  putStrLn $ "Sin(" ++ show x ++ ") = " ++ show result
```

Explanation:
- We define a foreign import declaration for the `sin` function from the C `math.h` library using the `ForeignFunctionInterface` pragma.
- The `c_sin` function has a type signature that corresponds to the C function signature.
- In the `main` function, we call the `c_sin` function with a `Double` argument and convert the result back to a `Double` using `realToFrac`.

To run this program, you'll need to compile it with GHC and link against the C math library. Then you can execute the program to see the sine of a given angle calculated using the C `sin` function.

These advanced topics in Haskell provide powerful tools and techniques for various tasks, including concurrent programming with STM and interfacing with C libraries using FFI.

  putStrLn "V matrix:"
  print v
```

Explanation:
- We import modules from `Numeric.LinearAlgebra` for linear algebra operations.
