# Lesson 1: Introduction to R Programming

1.1 Installing R:
First, you need to install R on your system. You can download the R installer from the official website: https://www.r-project.org/. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

1.2 Installing RStudio:
While R itself provides a console for running code, RStudio is a powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R that makes coding more convenient. You can download RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/. Install it after downloading.

1.3 Getting Started with RStudio:
Open RStudio after installation. You'll see a console window where you can type and execute R code. You'll also see panels for scripts, plots, environment, etc. Familiarize yourself with the layout.

1.4 Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Let's start with some simple arithmetic operations.

```r
# Addition
3 + 5

# Subtraction
10 - 7

# Multiplication
4 * 6

# Division
20 / 5
```

1.5 Variables:
In R, you can store values in variables. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dots, but cannot start with a number. Let's assign some values to variables.

```r
# Assigning values to variables
x <- 10
y <- 5

# Performing operations using variables
z <- x + y
z
```

1.6 Data Types:
R supports various data types including numeric, character, logical, and more.

```r
# Numeric
num_var <- 10

# Character
char_var <- "Hello, World!"

# Logical
logical_var <- TRUE
```

1.7 Vectors:
One of the fundamental data structures in R is a vector. A vector is a collection of elements of the same data type.

```r
# Creating a numeric vector
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Creating a character vector
char_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "orange")
```

1.8 Indexing and Slicing:
You can access elements of a vector using indexing.

```r
# Accessing elements of a vector
numeric_vector[1]  # Access first element
numeric_vector[2:4]  # Access elements 2 to 4
char_vector[2]  # Access second element of char_vector
```

This is just a starting point. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into more advanced concepts in R programming. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!

Lesson 2: Advanced Data Structures and Control Structures

2.1 Matrices:
A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure in R.

```r
# Creating a matrix
mat <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
print(mat)
```

2.2 Lists:
A list is a versatile data structure in R that can hold elements of different data types.

```r
# Creating a list
my_list <- list(name = "John", age = 30, married = TRUE)
print(my_list)
```

2.3 Data Frames:
Data frames are used to store tabular data, similar to a spreadsheet or a database table.

```r
# Creating a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
  age = c(30, 25, 35),
  married = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
print(df)
```

2.4 Control Structures:
Control structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.

2.4.1 if-else Statements:
```r
# if-else statement
x <- 10
if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 5")
}
```

2.4.2 for Loops:
```r
# for loop
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
```

2.4.3 while Loops:
```r
# while loop
x <- 1
while (x <= 5) {
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
}
```

2.4.4 Functions:
Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable pieces of code.

```r
# Function definition
square <- function(x) {
  return(x^2)
}

# Function call
result <- square(5)
print(result)
```

2.5 Reading and Writing Data:
R provides functions to read and write data from various file formats.

```r
# Reading data from a CSV file
my_data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Writing data to a CSV file
write.csv(my_data, "output.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
