# Lesson 1: Introduction to C#

C# is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is part of the .NET framework, which provides a comprehensive programming model for building various types of applications.

Before we begin coding, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio: Visual Studio is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for C# and other languages. You can download the community edition for free from the official website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

2. Install .NET SDK: .NET Software Development Kit (SDK) includes everything you need to build and run .NET applications. You can download it from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet

Once you have installed Visual Studio and the .NET SDK, you're ready to write your first C# program.

Let's start with a simple "Hello World" program.

```csharp
// Hello World Program in C#
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- `// Hello World Program in C#`: This is a comment. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used for documentation or to make code more readable.
- `using System;`: This line tells the compiler to include the `System` namespace, which contains fundamental classes and base types.
- `class Program`: This declares a class named `Program`.
- `static void Main(string[] args)`: This is the entry point of the program. It's a static method named `Main` that takes an array of strings as arguments.
- `Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");`: This line prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console.

Compile and run the program to see the output "Hello, world!" printed on the console.

Congratulations! You've written your first C# program. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into the basics of C# syntax and data types.

Lesson 2: Basic Syntax and Data Types

Now that you've written your first C# program, let's delve deeper into the language's syntax and data types.

1. Comments: In C#, you can use single-line comments starting with // or multi-line comments enclosed in /* */. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used for documentation or to make code more readable.

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment

/*
   This is a multi-line comment
   It can span multiple lines
*/
```

2. Variables and Data Types: Variables are used to store data in a program. C# is a statically typed language, meaning you must declare the data type of a variable before using it. Here are some common data types:

```csharp
// Integer types
int num1 = 10;
uint num2 = 20;
long num3 = 1000000000;
ulong num4 = 2000000000;

// Floating-point types
float floatValue = 3.14f;
double doubleValue = 3.14159;
decimal decimalValue = 3.1415926535897932384626433832m;

// Character type
char charValue = 'A';

// Boolean type
bool isTrue = true;

// String type
string message = "Hello, world!";
```

3. Type Conversion: Sometimes, you may need to convert data from one type to another. C# supports implicit and explicit type conversion.

```csharp
int num1 = 10;
float floatValue = num1; // Implicit conversion (int to float)

float floatValue = 3.14f;
int num2 = (int)floatValue; // Explicit conversion (float to int)
```

4. Constants: Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned. They are declared using the `const` keyword.

```csharp
const double Pi = 3.14159;
```

5. Operators: C# supports various operators for performing arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operations.

```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

int sum = a + b; // Addition
int difference = a - b; // Subtraction
int product = a * b; // Multiplication
int quotient = a / b; // Division
int remainder = a % b; // Modulus

bool isEqual = (a == b); // Equality
bool isGreater = (a > b); // Greater than
bool logicalAnd = (true && false); // Logical AND
bool bitwiseAnd = (5 & 3); // Bitwise AND
```

Experiment with these concepts in Visual Studio by creating new projects and writing code snippets to reinforce your understanding. In the next lesson, we'll cover control flow statements and decision-making in C#.

Lesson 3: Control Flow and Decision Making

Control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your program. They include conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while, do-while), and branching statements (break, continue, return).

1. Conditional Statements (if-else):
   Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

```csharp
int num = 10;

if (num > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is positive");
}
else if (num < 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is negative");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is zero");
}
```

2. Loops:
   Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

   - For Loop:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

   - While Loop:

```csharp
int num = 0;
while (num < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);
    num++;
}
```

   - Do-While Loop:

```csharp
int num = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);
    num++;
} while (num < 5);
```

3. Branching Statements:
   Branching statements alter the normal flow of a loop or switch statement.

   - Break: Terminates the loop or switch statement.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        break;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

   - Continue: Skips the rest of the loop iteration and continues with the next iteration.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 2)
    {
        continue;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

   - Return: Exits the current method and returns control to the caller.

```csharp
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

Experiment with these control flow statements to understand how they affect the flow of your program. In the next lesson, we'll cover arrays, collections, and methods.

Lesson 4: Arrays, Collections, and Methods

Arrays and collections are used to store multiple values of the same type, while methods are used to organize code into reusable blocks. Let's explore these concepts in C#.

1. Arrays:
   An array is a collection of elements of the same data type arranged in contiguous memory locations. You can access individual elements using their index.

```csharp
// Declaring and initializing an array
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // An array of 5 integers
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;
numbers[3] = 40;
numbers[4] = 50;

// Accessing array elements
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]); // Output: 10
Console.WriteLine(numbers[3]); // Output: 40
```

2. Collections:
   Collections are classes provided by .NET to store and manipulate groups of objects. One commonly used collection type is `List<T>`, which is dynamically resizable.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Declaring and initializing a list
List<string> names = new List<string>();
names.Add("Alice");
names.Add("Bob");
names.Add("Charlie");

// Accessing list elements
Console.WriteLine(names[0]); // Output: Alice
Console.WriteLine(names.Count); // Output: 3 (Number of elements in the list)
```

3. Methods:
   A method is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods can have parameters and return values.

```csharp
// Method with parameters and return value
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

// Calling the method
int result = Add(5, 3);
Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 8
```

4. Method Overloading:
   Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

```csharp
// Method overloading
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

double Add(double a, double b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

5. Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference:
   By default, C# uses pass by value for method arguments, meaning a copy of the argument is passed to the method. However, you can use the `ref` and `out` keywords to pass arguments by reference.

```csharp
void ModifyValue(int x)
{
    x = x * 2;
}

void ModifyValue(ref int x)
{
    x = x * 2;
}

int num = 5;
ModifyValue(num); // Pass by value
Console.WriteLine(num); // Output: 5

ModifyValue(ref num); // Pass by reference
Console.WriteLine(num); // Output: 10
```

Experiment with arrays, collections, and methods in your projects to understand how they work and when to use them. In the next lesson, we'll cover object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Lesson 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). In C#, classes are used to define objects and their behavior. Let's explore the key OOP concepts in C#:

1. Classes and Objects:
   A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects.

```csharp
// Class definition
class Car
{
    // Properties
    public string Model;
    public string Color;
    
    // Method
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started.");
    }
}

// Creating objects
Car car1 = new Car();
car1.Model = "Toyota";
car1.Color = "Red";
car1.Start(); // Output: Car started.
```

2. Constructors:
   Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They are called automatically when an object is created.

```csharp
class Car
{
    public string Model;
    public string Color;
    
    // Constructor
    public Car(string model, string color)
    {
        Model = model;
        Color = color;
    }
}

// Creating objects using constructor
Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Blue");
```

3. Inheritance:
   Inheritance is a mechanism where a class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (base class or parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

```csharp
// Base class
class Vehicle
{
    public string Type;
    
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle is driving.");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Car : Vehicle
{
    public string Model;
    
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car started.");
    }
}
```

4. Polymorphism:
   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables methods to behave differently based on the object calling them.

```csharp
// Base class
class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}
```

5. Encapsulation:
   Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes necessary functionality through methods.

```csharp
class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance;

    // Method to deposit money
    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        balance += amount;
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

These are the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in C#. Practice creating classes, defining properties and methods, and utilizing inheritance and polymorphism in your projects. In the next lesson, we'll explore more advanced topics such as interfaces, abstract classes, and exception handling.

Lesson 6: Advanced Topics in C#

In this lesson, we'll cover some advanced topics in C# programming that will enhance your understanding and skills.

1. Interfaces:
   Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement. They specify a set of methods and properties that implementing classes must provide. Interfaces enable polymorphism and decouple code, promoting flexibility and extensibility.

```csharp
// Interface definition
interface IShape
{
    double CalculateArea();
}

// Class implementing interface
class Circle : IShape
{
    public double Radius;

    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}
```

2. Abstract Classes:
   Abstract classes are similar to interfaces but can also contain implementation details. They cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract members (methods or properties without implementation) that must be implemented by derived classes.

```csharp
// Abstract class definition
abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
}

// Derived class implementing abstract class
class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius;

    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}
```

3. Exception Handling:
   Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle runtime errors and unexpected situations in your code. C# provides try-catch-finally blocks to handle exceptions.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0;
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    // Handle specific exception
    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle general exception
    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    // Code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred
}
```

4. Generics:
   Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with placeholders for data types. They provide type safety and code reusability by allowing you to write code that works with any data type.

```csharp
// Generic class
class GenericList<T>
{
    private List<T> items = new List<T>();

    public void Add(T item)
    {
        items.Add(item);
    }

    public T Get(int index)
    {
        return items[index];
    }
}

// Usage of generic class
GenericList<int> intList = new GenericList<int>();
intList.Add(10);
int value = intList.Get(0);
```

5. Delegates and Events:
   Delegates are type-safe function pointers that allow you to define and reference methods dynamically. Events are a special type of delegate used to notify subscribers when an event occurs.

```csharp
// Delegate definition
delegate void EventHandler(string message);

// Event declaration
class Publisher
{
    public event EventHandler Notify;

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // Raise event
        Notify?.Invoke("Something happened!");
    }
}

// Subscriber
class Subscriber
{
    public void HandleEvent(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event handled: " + message);
    }
}

// Usage of delegates and events
Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

// Subscribe to the event
publisher.Notify += subscriber.HandleEvent;

// Trigger the event
publisher.DoSomething(); // Output: Event handled: Something happened!
```

These advanced topics will deepen your understanding of C# programming and enable you to write more robust and flexible applications. Practice implementing these concepts in your projects to solidify your knowledge. In the next lesson, we'll explore file I/O, asynchronous programming, and LINQ.

Lesson 7: File I/O, Asynchronous Programming, and LINQ

In this lesson, we'll cover file input/output (I/O), asynchronous programming, and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which are essential topics in C# development.

1. File Input/Output (I/O):
   File I/O operations allow you to read from and write to files on the disk. C# provides classes like `FileStream`, `StreamReader`, and `StreamWriter` for file I/O operations.

```csharp
// Writing to a file
using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("test.txt"))
{
    writer.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
}

// Reading from a file
using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("test.txt"))
{
    string line = reader.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine(line); // Output: Hello, world!
}
```

2. Asynchronous Programming:
   Asynchronous programming enables you to execute tasks concurrently, improving the responsiveness of your applications. C# provides the `async` and `await` keywords to work with asynchronous methods.

```csharp
// Asynchronous method
async Task<string> DownloadDataAsync(string url)
{
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        return await client.GetStringAsync(url);
    }
}

// Calling asynchronous method
Task<string> task = DownloadDataAsync("https://example.com");
string data = await task;
```

3. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ):
   LINQ is a powerful feature that allows you to query data from various sources such as collections, arrays, databases, XML, and more using a SQL-like syntax.

```csharp
// LINQ query to filter and select elements
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var evenNumbers = from num in numbers
                  where num % 2 == 0
                  select num;
foreach (var num in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num); // Output: 2, 4
}
```

4. Exception Handling in Asynchronous Code:
   When working with asynchronous code, it's essential to handle exceptions properly. You can use try-catch blocks as usual, and the `await` keyword ensures that exceptions are propagated correctly.

```csharp
try
{
    string data = await DownloadDataAsync("invalid_url"); // This may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
}
```

5. LINQ with File I/O:
   You can use LINQ to perform various operations on data read from files, such as filtering, sorting, and projecting.

```csharp
// Reading lines from a file and filtering using LINQ
List<string> lines = File.ReadAllLines("data.txt")
                         .Where(line => line.Contains("keyword"))
                         .ToList();
```

These topics will broaden your capabilities as a C# programmer and enable you to work with different types of data and perform operations efficiently. Experiment with file I/O, asynchronous programming, and LINQ in your projects to gain hands-on experience. In the next lesson, we'll explore more advanced topics such as networking, encryption, and security-related concepts.

Lesson 8: Networking, Encryption, and Security in C#

In this lesson, we'll delve into networking, encryption, and security-related concepts in C#. These topics are crucial for understanding how to build secure and reliable applications, especially in the field of cybersecurity.

1. Networking:
   C# provides classes in the `System.Net` namespace for networking tasks such as sending and receiving data over the network using TCP/IP or UDP protocols.

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Sockets;

// TCP client example
TcpClient client = new TcpClient();
client.Connect(IPAddress.Parse("127.0.0.1"), 8080);

NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();
byte[] data = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("Hello, server!");
stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);

// TCP server example
TcpListener server = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, 8080);
server.Start();

TcpClient client = server.AcceptTcpClient();
NetworkStream stream = client.GetStream();
byte[] data = new byte[1024];
int bytesRead = stream.Read(data, 0, data.Length);
string message = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data, 0, bytesRead);
Console.WriteLine("Received: " + message);
```

2. Encryption:
   Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. C# provides various cryptographic algorithms and classes in the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace for encryption and decryption tasks.

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

// Symmetric encryption (AES)
using Aes aes = Aes.Create();
aes.GenerateKey();
aes.GenerateIV();

byte[] encryptedData;
byte[] decryptedData;

using (ICryptoTransform encryptor = aes.CreateEncryptor())
{
    encryptedData = encryptor.TransformFinalBlock(data, 0, data.Length);
}

using (ICryptoTransform decryptor = aes.CreateDecryptor())
{
    decryptedData = decryptor.TransformFinalBlock(encryptedData, 0, encryptedData.Length);
}
```

3. Security Best Practices:
   When working with sensitive data or network communications, it's essential to follow security best practices such as using HTTPS for web communications, securely storing passwords using salted hashing algorithms, and implementing proper input validation and access control.

```csharp
// Example of password hashing with salt
string password = "password123";
byte[] salt = GenerateSalt();
string hashedPassword = HashPassword(password, salt);

// Input validation
if (!IsValidInput(input))
{
    throw new ArgumentException("Invalid input.");
}

// Access control
if (!IsAuthorized(user))
{
    throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("Access denied.");
}
```

4. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS):
   SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols used to secure communications over the internet. C# provides classes like `SslStream` for implementing SSL/TLS encryption in network communications.

```csharp
using System.Net.Security;

// SSL/TLS client example
TcpClient client = new TcpClient();
client.Connect("example.com", 443);

SslStream sslStream = new SslStream(client.GetStream());
sslStream.AuthenticateAsClient("example.com");
```

These concepts will provide you with a solid foundation for working with networking, encryption, and security-related tasks in C#. Experiment with these topics in your projects and explore additional resources to deepen your understanding. In the next lesson, we'll cover advanced C# techniques such as reflection, attributes, and dynamic programming.

Lesson 9: Advanced C# Techniques

In this lesson, we'll explore advanced C# techniques that will expand your programming capabilities and allow you to write more flexible and efficient code.

1. Reflection:
   Reflection allows you to inspect and manipulate types, methods, properties, and other members of assemblies at runtime. It's commonly used for dynamic loading of assemblies, creating instances of types dynamically, and invoking methods dynamically.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

// Get type information
Type type = typeof(MyClass);
Console.WriteLine("Type Name: " + type.Name);

// Get method information
MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("MyMethod");
Console.WriteLine("Method Name: " + method.Name);

// Invoke method dynamically
object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
method.Invoke(instance, null);
```

2. Attributes:
   Attributes are metadata tags that provide additional information about types, methods, properties, and other program elements. They can be used for documentation, configuration, validation, and more.

```csharp
using System;

// Custom attribute definition
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
class MyAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Description { get; }

    public MyAttribute(string description)
    {
        Description = description;
    }
}

// Applying attribute to a class
[MyAttribute("This is a sample class")]
class MyClass
{
    // Class implementation
}
```

3. Dynamic Programming:
   Dynamic programming allows you to work with types dynamically at runtime. It's useful when dealing with COM interop, dynamic languages, or scenarios where type information is not known until runtime.

```csharp
// Example of dynamic programming
dynamic obj = GetDynamicObject();
Console.WriteLine(obj.SomeProperty);
obj.SomeMethod();
```

4. Parallel Programming:
   Parallel programming enables you to execute multiple tasks concurrently to improve performance and scalability. C# provides features like the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ) for parallelizing workloads.

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;

// Parallel programming example
Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Iteration: " + i);
});

// Asynchronous parallel processing with Task
Task.Run(() =>
{
    // Code to execute asynchronously
});
```

5. Code Optimization Techniques:
   To write efficient code, it's essential to optimize performance and memory usage. Techniques such as caching, lazy loading, and minimizing resource consumption can help improve the overall performance of your applications.

```csharp
// Example of lazy loading using Lazy<T>
Lazy<ExpensiveObject> lazyObject = new Lazy<ExpensiveObject>(() => new ExpensiveObject());

// Access the object
ExpensiveObject obj = lazyObject.Value;
```

These advanced techniques will enhance your C# programming skills and enable you to tackle complex problems more effectively.
