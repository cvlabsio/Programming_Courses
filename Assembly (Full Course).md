# Lesson 1: Introduction to Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that closely resembles machine code instructions. It's composed of mnemonics representing specific machine instructions, along with operands specifying the data the instructions operate on.

#### 1.1 Understanding the Basics

In assembly language, instructions operate on registers, memory locations, or immediate values. Registers are small storage locations directly accessible to the CPU.

Here are some common registers in x86 architecture:

- `eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, `edx`: General-purpose registers
- `esi`, `edi`: Index registers
- `ebp`, `esp`: Base pointer and stack pointer
- `eip`: Instruction pointer

#### 1.2 Hello World Example

Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program in assembly language.

```assembly
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; write syscall (stdout=1)
    mov eax, 4
    mov ebx, 1
    mov ecx, msg
    mov edx, 13
    int 0x80

    ; exit syscall
    mov eax, 1
    xor ebx, ebx
    int 0x80
```

### Lesson 2: Basic Assembly Instructions

Now, let's delve deeper into some basic assembly instructions.

#### 2.1 Data Movement Instructions

These instructions move data between registers and memory locations.

- `mov`: Move data from one location to another.
- `push` / `pop`: Push data onto the stack / pop data from the stack.
- `lea`: Load effective address (calculates the effective address of an operand into a register).

#### 2.2 Arithmetic Instructions

Assembly language provides instructions for basic arithmetic operations.

- `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- `inc`, `dec`: Increment, decrement.
- `imul`: Signed integer multiplication.
- `idiv`: Signed integer division.

#### 2.3 Control Flow Instructions

Control flow instructions alter the sequence of program execution.

- `jmp`: Unconditional jump.
- `je`, `jne`, `jl`, `jg`, `jle`, `jge`: Conditional jumps.
- `call`, `ret`: Call and return from a subroutine.

#### 2.4 Example: Addition Program

Let's create a simple program to add two numbers.

```assembly
section .data
    num1 dd 10
    num2 dd 20
    result dd 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Load data into registers
    mov eax, [num1]
    add eax, [num2]
    mov [result], eax

    ; Exit syscall
    mov eax, 1
    xor ebx, ebx
    int 0x80
```

### Lesson 3: Memory Access and Addressing Modes

Understanding memory access and addressing modes is crucial in assembly programming.

    array_size equ ($ - array) / 4
    sum dd 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov ecx, array_size      ; Counter for loop
    mov esi, array           ; Pointer to the array
    mov eax, 0               ; Initialize sum to 0

sum_loop:
    add eax, [esi]           ; Add current element to sum
    add esi, 4               ; Move to next element
    loop sum_loop            ; Decrement counter and loop if not zero

    ; Store sum
    mov [sum], eax

    ; Exit syscall
    mov eax, 1
    xor ebx, ebx
    int 0x80
```

    ; Result is in eax
    ; Exit syscall

factorial:
    ; Function prologue
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    sub esp, 4          ; Allocate space for local variables
    mov dword [ebp-4], 1   ; Initialize result to 1

    ; Factorial calculation
    cmp dword [ebp+8], 1   ; Check if n == 1
    jle .base_case         ; Jump to base case if true
    dec dword [ebp+8]      ; Decrement n
    push dword [ebp+8]     ; Push n onto the stack
    call factorial         ; Recursive call
    mov eax, [ebp-4]       ; Load result of recursive call
    imul eax, [ebp+8]      ; Multiply by n
    mov [ebp-4], eax       ; Store result
    jmp .done              ; Jump to done

.base_case:
    mov eax, 1             ; Base case: return 1

.done:
    ; Function epilogue
    mov esp, ebp
    pop ebp
    ret
```

    ; Odd
    ; Add code here to handle odd case
    jmp .end
.even:
    ; Even
    ; Add code here to handle even case
.end:
    ; Exit syscall
