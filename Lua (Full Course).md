**Lesson 1: Introduction to Lua**

Lua is a powerful, lightweight, and versatile scripting language. It's commonly used in various fields, including game development, embedded systems, and scripting in applications. In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of Lua programming from scratch.

**1.1 Getting Started**

Lua can be executed in several ways: through an interpreter, embedded in other applications, or as standalone scripts. For learning purposes, we'll start with using an interpreter.

First, ensure you have Lua installed on your system. You can download it from the official Lua website (https://www.lua.org/download.html). Once installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type `lua` to start the Lua interpreter.

```
-- Example 1.1: Hello World
print("Hello, world!")
```

Save the above code in a file named `hello.lua`, and run it using the Lua interpreter:

```
lua hello.lua
```

This should output:

```
Hello, world!
```

**1.2 Variables and Data Types**

In Lua, variables don't have predefined types. They can hold values of any type, and their type can change dynamically.

Variables can be assigned using the `=` operator.

```
-- Example 1.2: Variables and Data Types
age = 25
name = "John"
isMale = true
```

Here, `age` holds an integer, `name` holds a string, and `isMale` holds a boolean value.

**1.3 Control Structures**

Lua supports typical control structures like if-else, loops, and functions.

```
-- Example 1.3: Control Structures
if age >= 18 then
    print("You are an adult.")
else
    print("You are a minor.")
end

for i = 1, 5 do
    print("Iteration", i)
end

-- Define a function
function greet(name)
    print("Hello, " .. name .. "!")
end

greet("Alice")
```

**1.4 Tables**

Tables are Lua's only data structure, acting as associative arrays, lists, queues, etc.

```
-- Example 1.4: Tables
-- Creating a table
person = {name = "John", age = 30, gender = "male"}

-- Accessing table elements
print(person.name) -- Output: John
print(person["age"]) -- Output: 30

-- Adding new elements
person.city = "New York"

-- Iterating over a table
for key, value in pairs(person) do
    print(key, value)
end
```

**1.5 Functions**

Functions are first-class citizens in Lua.

```
-- Example 1.5: Functions
-- Define a function
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end

-- Call the function
result = add(10, 5)
print(result) -- Output: 15
```

**1.6 File I/O**

Lua supports basic file operations for input and output.

```
-- Example 1.6: File I/O
-- Open a file in write mode
file = io.open("data.txt", "w")

-- Write to the file
file:write("Hello, Lua!")

-- Close the file
file:close()

-- Open the file in read mode
file = io.open("data.txt", "r")

-- Read from the file
content = file:read("*a")
print(content) -- Output: Hello, Lua!

-- Close the file
file:close()
```

**1.7 Conclusion**

This concludes our first lesson on Lua programming. We've covered basic syntax, variables, control structures, tables, functions, and file I/O. Practice these concepts to solidify your understanding before moving on to more advanced topics. In the next lesson, we'll delve deeper into functions, scope, and modules.

**Lesson 2: Advanced Concepts in Lua**

In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into Lua programming, covering advanced topics such as functions, scope, modules, and error handling.

**2.1 Functions (Continued)**

Lua allows functions to return multiple values, making it flexible and powerful.

```
-- Example 2.1: Functions (Continued)
-- Define a function that returns multiple values
function calculateStats(numbers)
    local sum = 0
    local min = numbers[1]
    local max = numbers[1]
    
    for _, v in ipairs(numbers) do
        sum = sum + v
        if v < min then min = v end
        if v > max then max = v end
    end
    
    return sum, min, max
end

-- Call the function
local numbers = {10, 5, 7, 13, 20}
local total, min, max = calculateStats(numbers)

print("Total:", total)
print("Minimum:", min)
print("Maximum:", max)
```

**2.2 Scope**

Variables in Lua have either global or local scope. It's recommended to use local variables whenever possible to avoid unintended side effects.

```
-- Example 2.2: Scope
globalVar = 10 -- Global variable

do
    local localVar = 20 -- Local variable
    print(globalVar) -- Access global variable
    print(localVar) -- Access local variable
end

print(globalVar) -- Access global variable
print(localVar) -- Error: Attempt to access undefined variable
```

**2.3 Modules**

Lua supports modules, allowing you to organize code into reusable units. A module is simply a table that contains functions, variables, or other tables.

```
-- Example 2.3: Modules
-- Define a module
local myModule = {}

function myModule.greet(name)
    print("Hello, " .. name .. "!")
end

function myModule.farewell(name)
    print("Goodbye, " .. name .. "!")
end

return myModule
```

To use the module:

```
-- Example 2.3 (Continued)
local greetings = require("myModule")

greetings.greet("Alice") -- Output: Hello, Alice!
greetings.farewell("Bob") -- Output: Goodbye, Bob!
```

**2.4 Error Handling**

Lua provides robust error handling mechanisms using the `pcall` function.

```
-- Example 2.4: Error Handling
function divide(a, b)
    if b == 0 then
        error("Attempt to divide by zero!")
    else
        return a / b
    end
end

local success, result = pcall(divide, 10, 0)

if success then
    print("Result:", result)
else
    print("Error:", result)
end
```

**2.5 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've covered advanced concepts in Lua programming, including functions with multiple return values, scope, modules, and error handling. These concepts are essential for writing more complex Lua programs. Practice these concepts to strengthen your understanding, and feel free to explore Lua's documentation for more in-depth knowledge. In the next lesson, we'll explore Lua's powerful metaprogramming capabilities.

**Lesson 3: Metaprogramming and Advanced Techniques in Lua**

In this lesson, we'll delve into Lua's metaprogramming capabilities and explore advanced techniques such as metatables, coroutines, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

**3.1 Metatables**

Metatables in Lua allow you to define the behavior of tables, enabling powerful customization.

```
-- Example 3.1: Metatables
-- Create a metatable
local mt = {
    __index = function(table, key)
        return "Key '" .. key .. "' not found!"
    end
}

-- Create a table with the metatable
local t = setmetatable({}, mt)

-- Accessing a non-existent key
print(t.foo) -- Output: Key 'foo' not found!
```

Metatables can also be used to implement operator overloading, custom iteration, and more.

**3.2 Coroutines**

Coroutines in Lua allow for cooperative multitasking, enabling non-blocking operations and asynchronous programming.

```
-- Example 3.2: Coroutines
-- Define a coroutine
local co = coroutine.create(function()
    for i = 1, 3 do
        print("Coroutine", i)
        coroutine.yield() -- Suspend the coroutine
    end
end)

-- Resume the coroutine
coroutine.resume(co) -- Output: Coroutine 1
coroutine.resume(co) -- Output: Coroutine 2
coroutine.resume(co) -- Output: Coroutine 3
```

Coroutines are lightweight and can be used for tasks like asynchronous I/O, state machines, and more.

**3.3 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

While Lua doesn't have built-in support for classes, OOP can be implemented using tables and metatables.

```
-- Example 3.3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
-- Define a class
local Person = {
    name = "",
    age = 0,
    greet = function(self)
        print("Hello, my name is " .. self.name .. " and I am " .. self.age .. " years old.")
    end
}

-- Constructor
function Person:new(name, age)
    local obj = {}
    setmetatable(obj, self)
    self.__index = self
    obj.name = name
    obj.age = age
    return obj
end

-- Create an instance
local john = Person:new("John", 30)

-- Call a method
john:greet() -- Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

**3.4 Advanced Techniques**

Lua supports various advanced techniques such as functional programming, closures, and metaprogramming.

```
-- Example 3.4: Advanced Techniques
-- Functional programming
local function map(func, array)
    local result = {}
    for i, v in ipairs(array) do
        result[i] = func(v)
    end
    return result
end

local numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
local squared = map(function(x) return x * x end, numbers)
print(table.concat(squared, ", ")) -- Output: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
```

**3.5 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored Lua's metaprogramming capabilities, coroutines, object-oriented programming using tables and metatables, and advanced techniques like functional programming. These concepts empower you to write more expressive and flexible Lua code. Practice implementing these techniques in your projects to deepen your understanding and enhance your programming skills. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's integration capabilities and its use in various domains, including cybersecurity.

**Lesson 4: Lua in Cybersecurity**

Lua finds various applications in cybersecurity, including scripting, tool development, and penetration testing. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua can be utilized in cybersecurity tasks, such as network scanning, packet analysis, and automation.

**4.1 Network Scanning**

Lua can be used to develop custom network scanning tools or scripts to automate network reconnaissance tasks.

```
-- Example 4.1: Network Scanning
local socket = require("socket")

-- Define target IP and port range
local target_ip = "192.168.1.1"
local start_port = 1
local end_port = 100

-- Perform port scanning
for port = start_port, end_port do
    local s = socket.tcp()
    s:settimeout(1) -- Set timeout for connection attempt
    local result = s:connect(target_ip, port)
    if result == nil then
        print("Port " .. port .. ": Open")
    end
    s:close()
end
```

This script iterates through a range of ports and attempts to connect to each port on the specified target IP. If the connection attempt succeeds, it prints that the port is open.

**4.2 Packet Analysis**

Lua can also be integrated with packet analysis libraries like `pcap` or `wireshark` to analyze network traffic for security monitoring or intrusion detection purposes.

```
-- Example 4.2: Packet Analysis
local pcap = require("pcap")

-- Open a pcap file
local capture = pcap.open_offline("network_traffic.pcap")

-- Loop through packets
for packet in capture:pcap_loop() do
    -- Process packet data
    print("Packet captured:", packet)
end
```

This example reads packets from a pcap file and processes each packet for analysis. It could be extended to perform various security-related tasks such as identifying suspicious traffic patterns or extracting information from packets.

**4.3 Automation and Scripting**

Lua can automate repetitive tasks and interact with system utilities or APIs, making it useful for scripting in cybersecurity workflows.

```
-- Example 4.3: Automation Script
local os = require("os")

-- Run system command to gather system information
local system_info = os.execute("systeminfo")

-- Save system information to a file
local file = io.open("system_info.txt", "w")
file:write(system_info)
file:close()
```

This script executes a system command to gather system information and saves the output to a text file. It can be used as part of a larger automation process for gathering intelligence or managing system configurations in a cybersecurity context.

**4.4 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored how Lua can be applied in cybersecurity tasks, including network scanning, packet analysis, and automation. Lua's flexibility, simplicity, and integration capabilities make it a valuable tool for scripting and developing custom security solutions. Experiment with these examples and consider how Lua can enhance your cybersecurity workflows and projects. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's role in game development, another domain where Lua shines.

**Lesson 5: Lua in Game Development**

Lua has gained popularity in the game development industry due to its simplicity, flexibility, and integration capabilities with game engines. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua is used in game development for scripting, AI, game logic, and more.

**5.1 Scripting in Game Engines**

Many game engines, such as Unity3D, Corona SDK, and LÖVE2D, support Lua scripting for game development. Lua scripts can be used to define game mechanics, control player characters, handle user input, and more.

```lua
-- Example 5.1: Lua Scripting in LÖVE2D
function love.load()
    player = {
        x = 100,
        y = 100,
        speed = 200
    }
end

function love.update(dt)
    -- Move player based on input
    if love.keyboard.isDown("up") then
        player.y = player.y - player.speed * dt
    elseif love.keyboard.isDown("down") then
        player.y = player.y + player.speed * dt
    end
end

function love.draw()
    -- Draw player
    love.graphics.rectangle("fill", player.x, player.y, 50, 50)
end
```

In this example, Lua code controls the movement of a player character based on keyboard input in a game created using the LÖVE2D framework.

**5.2 AI and Game Logic**

Lua is often used to implement AI behaviors and game logic due to its ease of use and flexibility. Game developers can write Lua scripts to define enemy behavior, pathfinding algorithms, decision-making systems, and more.

```lua
-- Example 5.2: AI Behavior in Lua
function enemyAI(enemy)
    -- Implement AI behavior
    if player.distanceTo(enemy) < 200 then
        enemy.attack()
    else
        enemy.moveTowards(player.position)
    end
end
```

This Lua function represents a simple AI behavior for an enemy character in a game. It checks the distance between the enemy and the player, and either attacks the player if they are within range or moves towards the player's position otherwise.

**5.3 Modding and Extensibility**

Lua's dynamic nature and easy integration with game engines make it an ideal choice for modding support. Game developers can expose engine functionalities to Lua scripts, allowing modders to create custom content, modify game mechanics, and enhance gameplay experiences.

```lua
-- Example 5.3: Modding Support in Lua
function createCustomWeapon()
    local weapon = {
        name = "Custom Sword",
        damage = 50,
        type = "melee"
    }
    return weapon
end
```

This Lua function creates a custom weapon object with specified attributes. Modders can use functions like this to add new weapons, items, characters, and more to a game without modifying the game's core codebase.

**5.4 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored how Lua is used in game development for scripting game mechanics, implementing AI behavior, supporting modding, and extending game functionality. Lua's simplicity, flexibility, and integration capabilities make it a powerful tool for game developers of all skill levels. Experiment with Lua in your game development projects and explore its potential to streamline development workflows and enhance gameplay experiences. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's role in web development and its applications in creating dynamic websites and web applications.

**Lesson 6: Lua in Web Development**

While Lua is not as commonly used in web development as languages like JavaScript or Python, it still finds its niche in certain areas such as web servers, dynamic content generation, and backend scripting. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua is used in web development and its applications in creating dynamic websites and web applications.

**6.1 Lua in Web Servers**

Lua can be embedded within web servers to enable server-side scripting. One popular web server that supports Lua scripting is Nginx, which uses the ngx_lua module for embedding Lua code directly into server configuration files.

```lua
-- Example 6.1: Lua Scripting in Nginx
location /hello {
    default_type 'text/plain';
    content_by_lua_block {
        ngx.say("Hello, world!")
    }
}
```

In this example, a simple Nginx configuration block is provided with Lua code to handle requests to the `/hello` endpoint. When a request is made to this endpoint, the server responds with the text "Hello, world!" generated by the Lua script.

**6.2 Dynamic Content Generation**

Lua can be used to generate dynamic content for web pages by embedding Lua code directly into HTML templates. Frameworks like Lapis and Sailor provide tools and utilities for building web applications using Lua.

```lua
-- Example 6.2: Dynamic Content Generation with Lapis
-- app.moon
lapis = require("lapis")
app = lapis.Application()

app:get("/", function(self)
    return "Hello, world!"
end)

return app
```

In this example, a simple Lapis application is defined with a route handler for the root URL ("/"). When a request is made to this URL, the server responds with the text "Hello, world!" generated by the Lua function.

**6.3 Backend Scripting**

Lua can also be used for backend scripting in web applications, handling tasks such as data processing, database interactions, and business logic.

```lua
-- Example 6.3: Backend Scripting with Lua
-- server.lua
local socket = require("socket")
local server = assert(socket.bind("*", 8080))

while true do
    local client = server:accept()
    local request = client:receive()

    -- Process request
    local response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\nHello, world!"
    client:send(response)
    client:close()
end
```

In this example, a simple Lua script creates a TCP server listening on port 8080. When a client connects, the server sends a basic HTTP response with the text "Hello, world!".

**6.4 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored how Lua is used in web development for server-side scripting, dynamic content generation, and backend scripting. While Lua may not be as prevalent as other languages in the web development ecosystem, it still offers valuable capabilities for certain use cases. Experiment with Lua in your web development projects and explore its potential to simplify server-side logic, improve performance, and enhance the overall development experience. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's role in embedded systems and IoT (Internet of Things) development.

**Lesson 7: Lua in Embedded Systems and IoT**

Lua's lightweight nature and flexibility make it well-suited for embedded systems and IoT (Internet of Things) development. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua is used in these domains and its applications in developing firmware, automation scripts, and IoT devices.

**7.1 Lua in Firmware Development**

Lua can be embedded into firmware to provide scripting capabilities, allowing for dynamic behavior and customization in embedded systems.

```lua
-- Example 7.1: Lua Scripting in Firmware
-- Sample Lua script embedded in firmware
function toggle_led()
    if gpio.read(1) == gpio.LOW then
        gpio.write(1, gpio.HIGH)
    else
        gpio.write(1, gpio.LOW)
    end
end
```

In this example, a Lua script embedded in firmware controls the state of an LED connected to GPIO pin 1. The script toggles the LED on and off based on its current state.

**7.2 Automation Scripts**

Lua can be used to write automation scripts for controlling and monitoring embedded systems and IoT devices.

```lua
-- Example 7.2: Automation Script for IoT Device
-- Sample Lua script for temperature monitoring
function monitor_temperature()
    local temperature = read_temperature_sensor()
    if temperature > 30 then
        send_alert("Temperature is too high!")
    end
end
```

In this example, a Lua script reads temperature data from a sensor connected to an IoT device. If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the script sends an alert message.

**7.3 IoT Device Programming**

Lua can serve as the programming language for IoT devices, providing a high-level interface for interacting with sensors, actuators, and communication modules.

```lua
-- Example 7.3: Lua Programming for IoT Device
-- Sample Lua script for controlling a smart light
function toggle_light()
    if light_is_on() then
        turn_off_light()
    else
        turn_on_light()
    end
end
```

In this example, a Lua script controls the state of a smart light connected to an IoT device. The script toggles the light on and off based on its current state.

**7.4 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored how Lua is used in embedded systems and IoT development for firmware scripting, automation, and device programming. Lua's lightweight footprint, simplicity, and versatility make it an attractive choice for these domains, enabling rapid development and customization of embedded applications and IoT devices. Experiment with Lua in your embedded systems and IoT projects to leverage its strengths and unlock new possibilities in device programming and automation. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's role in scientific computing and data analysis.

**Lesson 8: Lua in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis**

Lua, although not as widely used as languages like Python or MATLAB in scientific computing, can still be a valuable tool for data analysis, numerical computation, and scientific simulations. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua is utilized in scientific computing and its applications in data analysis tasks.

**8.1 Lua for Data Analysis**

Lua can be used for data analysis tasks such as data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. While Lua does not have built-in libraries for these tasks, third-party libraries like Torch7 and LuaRocks provide functionalities for numerical computation and data processing.

```lua
-- Example 8.1: Data Analysis with Lua
-- Using Torch7 for numerical computation
require 'torch'

-- Create a tensor
a = torch.Tensor({{1, 2}, {3, 4}})
print(a)

-- Perform matrix multiplication
b = torch.Tensor({{1, 0}, {0, 1}})
c = torch.mm(a, b)
print(c)
```

In this example, Torch7, a popular numerical computing library for Lua, is used to perform matrix multiplication.

**8.2 Lua for Scientific Simulations**

Lua can also be used for scientific simulations, modeling physical systems, and solving differential equations. While Lua itself does not provide extensive support for these tasks, libraries like SciLua and GSL Shell offer functionalities for scientific computing and simulations.

```lua
-- Example 8.2: Scientific Simulation with Lua
-- Using GSL Shell for scientific computing
require 'gsl'

-- Define a function to solve
function f(x)
    return math.sin(x) + math.cos(x)
end

-- Solve using root finding methods
result = gsl.root.brent(f, 0, math.pi)
print(result)
```

In this example, GSL Shell, a Lua interface to the GNU Scientific Library, is used to find the root of a mathematical function.

**8.3 Lua for Visualization**

Lua can be integrated with visualization libraries like Lua-SDL or LuaGL for creating interactive visualizations and graphical representations of data.

```lua
-- Example 8.3: Data Visualization with Lua
-- Using Lua-SDL for simple graphics
local sdl = require "SDL"

-- Initialize SDL
sdl.init(sdl.flags.Video)

-- Create a window
local win = sdl.createWindow("Lua-SDL Demo", sdl.window.PosUndefined, sdl.window.PosUndefined, 800, 600, sdl.window.Resizable)

-- Main loop
local running = true
while running do
    -- Process events
    for event in sdl.pollEvent() do
        if event.type == sdl.event.Quit then
            running = false
        end
    end

    -- Draw graphics (e.g., plot data)
    -- ...

    -- Update screen
    sdl.renderPresent(win)
end

-- Clean up
sdl.quit()
```

In this example, Lua-SDL is used to create a simple window for graphics rendering. This can be extended to visualize data or simulate graphical representations of scientific phenomena.

**8.4 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored how Lua can be used in scientific computing for tasks such as data analysis, numerical computation, scientific simulations, and data visualization. While Lua may not be as prevalent as other languages like Python or MATLAB in this domain, it still offers valuable capabilities for scientific computing tasks, especially when combined with third-party libraries and tools. Experiment with Lua in your scientific computing projects and explore its potential to streamline data analysis workflows, perform numerical computations, and visualize scientific data. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's role in application scripting and automation.

**Lesson 8: Lua in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis**

Lua might not be as widely used as Python or R in scientific computing and data analysis, but it still has its place in these domains due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of integration with C/C++ libraries. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua can be used for scientific computing tasks such as numerical simulations, data manipulation, and visualization.

**8.1 Numerical Computing with LuaJIT**

LuaJIT (Just-In-Time Compiler for Lua) provides a high-performance execution environment for Lua code, making it suitable for numerical computing tasks.

```lua
-- Example 8.1: Numerical Computing with LuaJIT
local ffi = require("ffi")
local gsl = ffi.load("gsl") -- Load GSL library

ffi.cdef[[
    double gsl_sf_bessel_J0(double x);
]]

-- Calculate Bessel function J0(x)
local x = 5.0
local result = gsl.gsl_sf_bessel_J0(x)
print("Bessel function J0(", x, ") =", result)
```

In this example, LuaJIT is used with the GSL (GNU Scientific Library) to calculate the Bessel function J0(x).

**8.2 Data Analysis with Lua**

While Lua doesn't have extensive built-in support for data analysis, libraries such as Torch and LuaDataFrames provide tools for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

```lua
-- Example 8.2: Data Analysis with Torch
require 'torch'
require 'nn'

-- Define a neural network
model = nn.Sequential()
model:add(nn.Linear(10, 5))
model:add(nn.Tanh())
model:add(nn.Linear(5, 1))
model:add(nn.Sigmoid())

-- Generate random input data
input = torch.randn(10)

-- Forward pass through the network
output = model:forward(input)
print(output)
```

In this example, Torch, a scientific computing framework for Lua, is used to define and evaluate a simple neural network.

**8.3 Visualization**

While Lua doesn't have native plotting libraries, it can interface with plotting libraries written in other languages such as Python or JavaScript.

```lua
-- Example 8.3: Visualization with Plotly (using luaplotly)
local plotly = require('plotly')
local plot = plotly.plot
local layout = plotly.layout

x = {1, 2, 3, 4}
y = {10, 11, 12, 13}

-- Create a scatter plot
plot({
    data = {scatter = {x = x, y = y, mode = "lines+markers"}},
    layout = {title = "Lua Plotly Example"}
})
```

In this example, Lua interfaces with Plotly, a JavaScript-based plotting library, using the `luaplotly` module to create a simple scatter plot.

**8.4 Conclusion**

In this lesson, we've explored how Lua can be used in scientific computing and data analysis tasks, including numerical computing with LuaJIT, data analysis with Torch and LuaDataFrames, and visualization with external plotting libraries. While Lua may not be as feature-rich as other languages in this domain, it still offers valuable capabilities for certain scientific computing tasks, especially when combined with external libraries and frameworks. Experiment with Lua in your scientific computing and data analysis projects to leverage its strengths and explore its potential in these domains. In the next lesson, we'll discuss Lua's role in system scripting and automation.

**Lesson 9: Lua in System Scripting and Automation**

Lua can be a powerful tool for system scripting and automation tasks due to its simplicity, flexibility, and lightweight nature. In this lesson, we'll explore how Lua can be used for system administration, task automation, and scripting in various operating systems.

**9.1 Lua for System Administration**

Lua can be used for system administration tasks such as configuration management, log parsing, and system monitoring.

```lua
-- Example 9.1: Log Parsing with Lua
-- Parse Apache log file and count occurrences of each URL
local log_file = io.open("access.log", "r")
local url_count = {}

for line in log_file:lines() do
    local url = string.match(line, "%s+([^%s]+)%s+HTTP")
    if url then
        url_count[url] = (url_count[url] or 0) + 1
    end
end

for url, count in pairs(url_count) do
    print(url, count)
end
```

In this example, Lua is used to parse an Apache access log file and count the occurrences of each URL.

local server = assert(socket.bind("*", 8080))

while true do
    local client = server:accept()
    local request = client:receive()

    -- Process request
    local response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\nHello, world!"
    client:send(response)
    client:close()
end
```

In this example, a simple Lua script creates a TCP server listening on port 8080. When a client connects, the server sends a basic HTTP response with the text "Hello, world!".
